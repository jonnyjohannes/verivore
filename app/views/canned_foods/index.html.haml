      This 'canning calculator' is here to help you navigate the awesome but super inaccessible PDFs that the 
      = link_to "USDA has on canning information", "http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/publications_usda.html"
    
    
    %p Right now I've only scrapped the veggie info, but more will come shortly.
  
    %p So peruse the list to the left (or you can search for a food by name), when you click on one you'll be taken to a details page with a map that you can click on to find out what your elevation is and the corresponding canning pressure that you'll have to process to.
  
    %p I hope you find this easier to navigate than the USDA's pdfs or at the very least enjoy the bubble that finds your elevation on the map.
  
    %p Happy canning, and please avoid botulism!
