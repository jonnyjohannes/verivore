Principal photography took place in 2007 in Southern California; in post-production, scenes were supplemented with CGI skylines, backgrounds, vehicles and people. Changeling premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim. Its October 2008 theatrical release met with a more mixed reaction; the acting and story were generally praised, while criticism focused on the conventional staging and lack of nuance. Changeling earned $113 million in box office revenue worldwide; it received nominations in three Academy Award and eight BAFTA Award categories.
